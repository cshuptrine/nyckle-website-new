<br><h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2><br>

These Terms and Conditions and any separate agreements whereby Discoverable Marketing provides services to the Client shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of North Carolina, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms and Conditions or the services provided by Discoverable Marketing shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Durham North Carolina and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.<br>
