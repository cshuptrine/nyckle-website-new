I"ý<p>If you are reading an article about vintage motorcycles, you are likely more interested in seeing ads for the latest
Triumph Thruxton cafe racer than about woodworking supplies. For this reason, content publishers are
interested in classifying content into some shared high-level categories. The Interactive Advertising Bureau
(<a href="https://www.iab.com/">IAB</a>) publishes a common set of <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/content-taxonomy/">categories</a> that is
used for this purpose. The categories are hierarchical and contain about 600 categories at the lowest level.
In this post, we look at how you can use Machine Learning (ML) to automatically categorize text and image data into IAB
categories without any labeled data or ML expertise.</p>
