Because we are C# nerds and because production ML is a <a href="https://www.nyckel.com/blog/ml-too-hard-for-software-developers/">whole lot more</a> than training a model. You shouldnâ€™t need to know anything about PyTorch, tensors, or GPUs to use ML. More on that in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzawKd_7WDY">short video</a>.</em></p>
