I"›<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs">this scene in HBOâ€™s Silicon Valley</a>, I decided to build a website that identifies whether a photo is of a hot dog. Below is the magical line of JavaScript code that executes the image recognition:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">({</span>
    <span class="na">url</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">https://www.nyckel.com/v0.9/functions/km6svjpscep917bc/invoke</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">post</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">data</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">formdata</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">contentType</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">processData</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">dataType</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">json</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">success</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">displayResult</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, so maybe itâ€™s 12 lines of code. But it could be one without all that whitespace. You can see this code in action, and even try to identify if your photo is of a hot dog by visiting www.ishotdog.com. (I challenge you to find an image that it gets wrong)</p>

<p>So whatâ€™s happening here? Well, the magic happens with an AJAX post to this URL:</p>

<pre><code class="language-url">https://www.nyckel.com/v0.9/functions/km6svjpscep917bc/invoke
</code></pre>

<p>That is a REST API endpoint for a Nyckel custom machine learning function. Developing a custom ML function from scratch would typically require setting up a lot of stuff, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn Python</li>
  <li>Learn Pytorch or TensorFlow</li>
  <li>Collect data</li>
  <li>Annotate data</li>
  <li>Implement active learning</li>
  <li>Choose a ML network and design loss function</li>
  <li>Provision GPU compute</li>
  <li>Track experiments, progress &amp; metadata</li>
  <li>Tweak hyperparameters to optimize performance</li>
  <li>Evaluate model performance</li>
  <li>Deploy your model on scalable compute</li>
  <li>Build an API to invoke your deployed model</li>
  <li>Call your function</li>
</ul>

<p>By using an auto machine learning service like Nyckel you can skip most of those steps and go straight to the fun part! Namely, this is whatâ€™s left:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collect data (e.g. find photos of hot dogs and not hot dogs)</li>
  <li>Annotate the data (e.g. click to train the model on which is which)</li>
  <li>Call your function (via API as in the code snippet above)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hereâ€™s a screenshot of how training the model in Nyckel looks:</p>

<figure class="figure">

    

    

    

    
        <div class="post-img">
        <!-- Add the 'boxed' class if 'box' attribute is 'yes' -->
        <img src="../images/2021/hotdog-training.webp" alt="Training a custom image classification function" class=" " style="border-radius: 20px; max-width: 100%" srcset="../images/2021/hotdog-training.webp 2x%" loading="lazy" />
    </div>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
        

</figure>

<p>The above screenshot shows that the model is already actively identifying the difference between a hot dog and a sandwich (is a hot dog a sandwich?!)</p>

<p>Nyckel abstracts away the normally laborious and expertise-required process to set up, train, implement, and deploy a machine learning model. Now it can be done in just a few minutes and deployed simply as the code above shows.</p>

<p>Check out this article if you want to see a more detailed walkthrough of getting a machine learning model up and running with Nyckel. And let me know in the comments if you find an image that IsHotDog.com identifies incorrectly!</p>
