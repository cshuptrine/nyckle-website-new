I"S<p>My name is Oscar and I’m a co-founder of <a href="https://www.nyckel.com">Nyckel</a>. We have developed a site that allows anyone to train and integrate a Machine Learning (ML) model into their application, and do so in less than an hour. We have put a lot of work into our Auto-ML system and in this blogpost I’m excited to share some benchmarking results against <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Google Vertex AI</a> (formerly Google AutoML) and <a href="https://huggingface.co/autotrain">Huggingface AutoNLP</a> comparing accuracy, training times and invoke latencies.</p>
