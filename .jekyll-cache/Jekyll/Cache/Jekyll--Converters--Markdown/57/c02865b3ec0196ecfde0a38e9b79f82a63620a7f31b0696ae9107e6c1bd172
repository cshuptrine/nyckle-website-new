The site helps people understand the sometimes mysterious entries on their credit card statement. It does so by hosting over 100,000 credit card charges along with crowd-sourced explanations. Making sure the content is up to date and informative is critical for WTC to stay relevant and to drive Google Ad traffic. After seeing revenue falter slowly over time, WTC was able to dramatically turn the situation around by using Nyckel to automate their content moderation process.</p>
