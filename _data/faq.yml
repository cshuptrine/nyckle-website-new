  - question: "How does the process work?"
    answer: "If you get the mini-report or Snapshot, we'll send it over within a week of you filling out the form. The full report will take 1-2 weeks to deliver."
  - question: "How is the report delivered?"
    answer: "You'll receive the report via a Notion workspace. We'll email you guest access, and all report sections will be divided into different pages for easy navigation. You'll also receive a Google doc with the raw data."
  - question: "What are the payment terms?"
    answer: "The Snapshot package is pre-pay via a CC portal. For the full Discoverable report, we offer net-30 terms, which can be paid via CC, ACH, or check."
  - question: "How does the refund guarantee work?"
    answer: "For both Snapshot and the full report, you can request a 100% refund within 3 days of receiving the report." 
  - question: "Why are seats limited?"
    answer: "The Google doc with the raw data can be shared internally without limits, but the number of people who get Notion access varies by report. Mini-report is 1; Snapshot is 2; and Full Report is 3. For Snapshot and Full Report, you can pay a one-time $49 per additional seat, which will last for as long as you have report access. We also offer a 'forever access' package for a one-time $399 which comes with 5 extra seats. We do this because we pay Notion for guest seats, so everyone who has active access incurs a cost." 
  - question: "Why is report access limited?"
    answer: "The Google doc with the raw data will be yours forever, but for the Notion reports, your access length is determined by package. Mini-report is 1 month; Snapshot is 6 months; and Full Report is 1 year. After that period, your access will end (but you only lose access to the pretty Notion template - you get to keep the raw data forever). For Snapshot and Full Report, you can pay a one-time $399 for forever access. This also comes with an additional 5 seats ($200 value). We do this because we pay Notion for guest seats, so everyone who has active access incurs a cost."
